# Thesis Supervision w/ Julian @TUM
If you are a TUM student and are interested in writing a thesis with me, this is the right place for you!

<p id="last-commit">Last updated: See timestamp of commit</p>

## Capacities: Full!
My capacities for this winter are almost full! I only take highly relevant topics (see below) and promising students.

## Topics
My main research interest is a toolkit called "pix:e - Player Experience Engine". The vision for it is to provide support in game development for the game designer and the team by breaking down complex tasks, tracking dependencies within the design, and helping in the ideation stage of a project. There exists a paper about [PaceMaker], the proof of concept in the early stages of the project. Since then, it has evolved from pacing considerations to general game design support in terms of player experience, pix:e. The project has many interesting sides for potential thesis topics. Here are the highest priority topics as of now.

#### Workflow Integration
Keywords: Frontend, Vue.js, Nuxt

Currently, pix:e is a loosely coupled collection of tools and features and it is missing a concrete workflow. Part of this topic would be to research sensible approaches and implement one (or a few) with a user-evaluation at the end.

#### Graph Traversal
Keywords: Pathfinding, Algorithms, Data-Analysis, Fullstack

pix:e is currently providng the ability to design a graph of player experiences, but there is no analysis of this graph and its dependencies implemented. Part of this topic would be to research ways to traverse this graph (i.e. pathfinding) and provide sensible data to the designer that gives insights into certain dependencies, like lock&key mechanics or whether certain requirements are being met (similar to [PaceMaker]'s pacing diagrams).
